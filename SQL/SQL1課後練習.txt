建foreign key

新增表格時
create table sql_customer(
id varchar2(10 byte)primary key,
name nvarchar2(20),
emp char (8 byte) references sql_emp(emp_id))

找尋在表格中大於一個數的資料
select * from table_nm
where 
column>= 'number';

找系統開發部姓王的
select * from table_nm
whrere name like='王%'and 部門='系統開發部';

找身高160與165
select * from height table
where in height in ('160','165')
;
檢討in後面要加括號

from 
   表格
where
    氫離子 in (7.5,8)
and
    綠 >= 0.6
and
    地點='T22';


檢討:是否為字串要分清楚再決定要不要''

練習5.2

檢討:order by 排序兩種要由外而內，兩個排序跳艦之間用","隔開

檢討:
新增的資料還是要用as改column name
order by要放最後面
